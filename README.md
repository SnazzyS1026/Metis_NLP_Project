# Sentiment Analysis of Disney Parks Reviews
This project was based on using data with primarily textual information to build an unsupervised learning model.  Specifically, a dataset of over 42,000 reviews on the Disney Parks in California, Paris, and Hong Kong was used for sentiment analysis across the parks.  Tools, such as VADER, NLTK, spaCy, and sklearn were used to help parse and tokenize documents for digestion.  Exploration into high frequency words and main topics assisted in the interpretation of the sentiment analysis in those reviews.

## Data
